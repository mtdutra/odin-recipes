# Odin Recipes
This is a very simple website showcasing a collection of homemade recipes.

It was built using plain HTML to practice fundamental web development concepts and skills like creating a basic web page structure using HTML and building a main index page with links to other pages.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a small multi-page website that presents a collection of recipes.

It focuses on clarity, structure, and consistency across pages — no CSS or JavaScript yet.

Each individual recipe page includes:
- A description
- An image of the finished dish
- A list of ingredients
- Step-by-step preparation instructions
- A link back to the homepage

The following recipes are currently available:
- Homemade Lasagna
- Chocolate Chip Cookies
- Homemade Lemonade

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to:  
- Create and organize multiple HTML files in a structured way  
- Link pages together using relative paths  
- Use proper HTML elements for content and layout  
- Maintain clean and readable code  
- Write clear documentation and meaningful Git commit messages

## Next Steps
- Style the website with CSS
- Improve layout and typography
